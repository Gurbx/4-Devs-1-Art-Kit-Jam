# 4-Devs-1-Art-Kit-Jam

This game was made for Miziziziz’s “Four Game Developers Jam Off the Same Art Kit” series that I was invited to participate in. Each participant had 48 hours to make a game only using art assets from Kenny’s platformer base pack.

You can watch the resulting video by Miziziziz here:
